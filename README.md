# Project 2 – U.S. Border Crossing Data Analysis

This project explores patterns in border crossing traffic across U.S. entry points using official government data. The goal is to visualize fluctuations in travel modes, volume, and seasonal or geographic trends.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze border crossing data by location, time, and mode of transport
- Identify seasonal, regional, and usage trends
- Build a static visualization dashboard for public insight

---
